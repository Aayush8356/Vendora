Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

### 3. Response timeline

We will respond to your report within **48 hours** and provide:
- Confirmation of receipt
- Initial assessment
- Timeline for investigation and fix

### 4. Disclosure process

- We will investigate the issue and determine its impact
- We will develop and test a fix
- We will coordinate the release of the fix
- We will publicly acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

## Security Best Practices

When using this template, please follow these security guidelines:

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use strong, unique secrets for JWT tokens
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use environment-specific configurations

### Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies
- Run `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Use tools like Dependabot for automated updates

### Authentication
- Implement proper password policies
- Use secure session management
- Enable two-factor authentication when possible
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Follow GDPR and privacy regulations

### Server Security
- Keep your server software updated
- Use firewalls and security groups
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Implement rate limiting

## Known Security Considerations

This is a demo template and includes:
- Mock authentication (should be replaced with real auth)
- Local storage for demo data (not suitable for production)
- Placeholder payment integration (implement real payments)

## Security Checklist for Production

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] Replace demo authentication with secure auth service
- [ ] Implement real database with proper security
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Set up proper error handling (don't expose stack traces)
- [ ] Configure security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Configure HTTPS with valid certificates
- [ ] Review and harden server configuration
- [ ] Implement backup and disaster recovery

## Third-Party Dependencies

We regularly monitor our dependencies for security issues. If you find a vulnerability in one of our dependencies, please also report it to the maintainers of that package.
